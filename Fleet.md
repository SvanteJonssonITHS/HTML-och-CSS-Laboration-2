## Cirrus Vision sf50

### Infotext
Cirrus’s Vision Jet is the only civilian certified single-engine jet in production. Cirrus designed it to be a simple step up from its SR series. Every switch, knob, and lever is in virtually the same place on the jet as on the piston airplanes. Designed as a “personal jet,” it is certified to only 28,000 feet; twin-engine business jets normally are certified to at least 40,000 feet. The SF50 also is unique in that it carries a whole-airplane parachute, a Cirrus signature feature.
